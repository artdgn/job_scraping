- eng:
    - add disk caching for feature building
    - add row to google-doc (when labeled)
    - auto ngrok and email url / reverse ssh?
    - auto-stuff / no waiting for scraping to finish:
        - auto recalc when 10 labels added
        - only retrain salaries when 10% salaries added
        - label new while scraping (append to last full one)  
        - auto reload when scraping is in progress and 10 more jobs were added 
        - scraping prog banner
    
    - add jokes: popups for labeling, waiting gifs
    - remove unused options and params
    - distinct relevance categories and definitions (with tooltips)
    - webapp: 
        - optional parameters (dedup, cache, ..) - remove or add to task-config
    - display closest labeled dup for each + simil score + label
    - refactor dups
    - tests        
    
- algo:
    - use keyword-score / order-score as surrogate labels (feature selection / pre-training) 
    - async feature selection / tuning and save into profile (or save config path)
    - autotuning de duping?
    - ranking model instead of regression

    - model improvement:
        - lemmatisation
        - only use NER words
        - w2v / sent2vec
        - self-supervision (title prediction) pretraining
    - try some imbalance handling techniques    
    - separate tuning and refitting
    - tests
